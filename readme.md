#Bean <small>Deprecated</small>

Bean is a survey build in Angular2, MongoDB, NodeJS and Express framework. It is designed to help match students and rate their interests and wellbeing for better social integration.


!!! This entire repo has been rewritten and made private for security of our users and improvements to the build. There is little existing code here that is currently being used so I am making it available for anybody to review or use as a reference for some of the libraries or platforms we integrated.
